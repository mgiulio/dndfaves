	<h2>About</h2>
	<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 90%; color: #444444;">
		(This is an old project that I resumed from my hard drive. The following notes are incomplete.)
	</p>
	<p>
		The inspiration for<a href="http://mgiulio.altervista.org/dndfaves/index.php"> this demo</a> came from <a href="http://www.deviantart.com">DeviantART</a>(DA). I was looking for  some concrete example to  exercise drag and drop(<em>DnD</em>) and so I  remembered the '<em>collect favorites</em>'  user interface used on that site.  Started only as an exercise in <em>DnD </em>with  time it evolved to a catch-all   exercise in design, CSS, JavaScript, server side code(PHP), Ajax and more. Please keep in mind that  it is not a complete application, read below for limitations.
	</p>
	
	Before jumping into some notes here a quick list of used languages, libraries and other software:
	<ul>
		<li>jQuery 1.5</li>
		<li>jQuery UI 1.8.9</li>
		<li>Notifications</li>
		<li>PHP 5</li>
		<li>Zend JSON</li>
		<li>Sessions, no db</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Features and limitations</h3>
As I said in the introduction, this demo is an (partial) imitation of the   drag and drop user interaction used on DA for collecting favorites, so I   won't go in datail about the user experience. Have a tour on that site to have an idea of what is going on here.

The collection folders management is limited,  it wasn't the main   focus of this exercise. The folders are  predetermined, user cannot add   new ones neither delete, rename them or  make any CRUD-like operation on   their faves.

<h3>Graphics Design</h3>
The page has a look that resemble the original DeviantART    design, both in the layout and in the color scheme.  The layout is full    screen and consist of a thin header, a narrow left sidebar colum for   the  (fictional) navigation, a larger main column for the thumbs and   finally  a header-like footer. The sidebar is fixed while the thumbs   colums is  fluid.

The thumbnails were generated offline with the DBP Gimp plugin.

The photoset used is from NASA.

Other graphics is original pure Programmer Art (TM) :).
<h3>HTML&amp;CSS</h3>
Layout:
The CSS implementation is from the LayoutPack templates by Chrish Coyer .
<h3>JavaScript</h3>
For the drag and drop functionality I picked up the <a href="http://">Draggable</a> and  <a href="http://">Droppable</a> Interactions of jQuery UI.

Draggables were used for the gallery thumbs:
<pre lang="javascript">$('.gallery .thumb').draggable({
    revert: 'invalid',
    helper: 'clone',
    opacity: 0.7,
    //cancel: 'img',
    cursor: 'move',
    zIndex: 100,
    start: function(e, ui) {
        $('#collect-checkbox').attr('checked', true).change();
    }
});
</pre>
I choose to use a transparent clone of the thumb as the drag proxy. Here I had<a href="http://"> some trouble</a> for a bug introduced in the  .clone() method of jQuery 1.5.
The revert option were used to 'elastically' return to its original position a not-dropped thumb.
The highest CSS layer in use has a vaue of 100.
Putting the thumbnail in the faves: Random point code
Used the Button widget.
